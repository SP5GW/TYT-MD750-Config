Software Installation on the PC
    Installation of the programming application 
        Generally this part does not cause any problems. At the time of writting this 
        manual download section of official Tytera page did not work (https://www.tyt888.com/download.html).
        Installer for the application has been downloaded from https://radiostrefa.eu/pl/p/Radiotelefon-TYT-MD-750-DMR-FM-VHFUHF/676 
        (pliki do pobrania). Downloaded repository titled "TYT-Oprogramowanie-2" includes zip repo called "MD-750 Driver and Software",
        which included two subfolders: C7000xxxx and xxxxv1.0.8. First directory includes USB driver, which missed digital signature so 
        it can be omitted. Second subfolder includes application installer, which shall be executed.
        At this stage it will be not possible to communicate with radio device until devices USB driver has been successfuly installed 
        (see next step).
    Installation of C7000 device usb driver
        It is not easy to find working usb driver for C7000 device. Package, which seems to work can be downloaded from:
        https://amaradio.cz/problem-s-driverem-k-tyt-md-750-vyresen/. Repository USB-driver shall be extrcted and then file "usblib_hrc7000"
        from it shall be executed in Administrator mode (right click on the file and select option Run as Administrator). As a result 
        popup Save As ... is displayed. This shall be ignored. After a while Windows confirms that driver has been successfuly installed.
        In my case to get TYT Programming cable/radio properly configured in Windows, I had to go to device manager (right clik on Windows 
        icon in Win 11 and select device manager). From there I had to locate C7000 walkie-takie and right click on it/select upgrade driver.
        This action creates device catalog lib-usbwin32 devices, which includes walkie-talkie-C7000 device in working state. 
    As a results of above steps you shall be able to start MD-750 app and read configuration from MD-750 device
    (Program -> Read). If there is still a problem with usb driver then you read operation will fail.
    It is assumed that prior to read attempt MD-750 has been connected to PC using supplied usb programming cable.
    Radio must be also switched on.

    It is critical when defining channels in programming application to add them to the Zone. If this step is skipped channels will not be
    visible in radio's menu...


    Basic MD-750 radio operation
    P2 - toggle between channel and VFO mode. In VFO mode (no channel number displayed next to frequency) you can input frequency 
    directly from the keyboard.

    Device configuration for radio's menu:
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set - access radio settings menu (to go back press BACK, to move arround use up/down keys)
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set -> (2) Squelsh:0 - to hear noise and be sure radio is in operation
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set -> (3) TX Power:Low - to set output power to low (about 1W)
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set -> (5) Band:Narrow - to set narrodband FM (important for some repeaters)
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set -> (9) Double-Wait:Single Wait (change between VFOs is done using P1 button)
        OK -> SET -> Radio Set -> (11) Beep -> Call Permit:Analog
        OK -> Zone -> Toggle between defined zones (zones group channels available from the radio's menu)

        OK -> SET -> Channel CFG -> (6) Freq Step:12.5k (according IARU Region 1 2m band plan)

        Channel Configuration in Analog Mode
            OK -> SET -> Channel CFG -> (7) Channel Type:FM - to put radio into analog mode

            Now you can go back to top menu level from where you can directly set radio frequecny. After pushing PTT button you 
            will be able to transmit. When you are trasmitting LED on the top of the radio changes from Green to Red.

            Configuring Analog Repeater
                We will use SR5WP (FM-Link repeater), its parameters are:
                TX Frequency: 438.6250MHz
                RX Frequency: 431.0250MHz (offset: -7.1MHz)
                CTCSS 127.3 Hz (transmitter and activation)

                Detailed information regarding repeater configuration can be found under the links below:
                    przemienniki.net 
                    fm-link.pl 
                Alternative method to define repeater from radio menu using offset (did not always worked for me due to lack of 
                offset availability in radio's menu)

                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDXTbgtwDEY

            The easiest way to define radio channel is via programming Software

            VFO -> Mode:Analog Set both VFOs to Analog mode
            Channel -> Add (Right Click on Channel) 
            Channel -> Add -> Mode:Analog
            Channel -> Add -> Name:SR5WP
            Channel -> Add -> RX Freq.:438.6250MHz
            Channel -> Add -> TX Feq.:431.0250MHz
            Channel -> Add -> Squelsh Level:0
            Channel -> Add -> Bandwith:12.5kHz
            Channel -> Add -> Tx Tone:127.3Hz
            Channel -> Add -> Rx Tone: 127.3Hz

            Zone -> Add (Right Click on Zone) -> Move new channel listed from Available to Member

            File -> Save:save configuration locally on the computer
            Program -> Write (write new configuration to the radio)

        Channel Configuration in Digital Mode
            In order to be able to attach to DMR network you need to register on radioid.net portal. This is mandatory step in order 
            to obtain Radio ID (DMR ID) parameter, which needs to be used as part of your equipment configuration.
            After your application has been approved you will receive two Radio ID numbers. Use the one with remark: DMR in subsequent 
            configuration steps of this manual.

        Configuring Digital DMR Repeater 
            We will use SR5WU (DMR repeater located in Warsaw-Ursynow), its parameters are:
                TX Frequency: 438.7750MHz
                RX Frequency: 431.1750MHz
                Offset: -7.6MHz 
                Color Code: 5
